# Twitter-cashtag-bot-blocklist
Blocklist of Twitter cashtag bots that advertise trading rooms and courses using Twitter cashtags ie. $NFLX

This is a blocklist of Twitter bot accounts that regularly post messages in Twitter cashtags to join a trading group or sign up for a trading course.

There are two ways to block these accounts - Programmatically and Manually:

Programmatically:
To import the blocklist, you will need a Twitter dev account (easy and free to sign up) and some code to iterate through each item and block it. 
This is beyond the scope of this repo.

Manually:
1) Save the .csv
2) Open the .csv in a spreadsheet reader of your choice. 
3) The hyperlinks to the Twitter profile in the "URL" column should be active and in blue. Click each url link.
4) Select "Block"
